    Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

    Given a set of n cities and an (asymmetric) distance matrix between them, 
    the goal is to find a roundtrip (tour) of minimal total length visiting each city exactly once.
    
    Instance Format:
      The instance file follows the TSPLib "explicit" format. It contains a keyword "DIMENSION:" 
      followed by the number of cities and later the keyword "EDGE_WEIGHT_SECTION", after which the 
      full distance matrix is listed row by row.
    
    Decision Variables:
      A candidate solution is represented as a list of integers of length n, where the i-th element 
      is the index of the city visited in the i-th position of the tour.
    
    Objective:
      Minimize the total travel distance, computed as the sum over consecutive pairs of cities plus 
      the closing distance from the last city back to the first.
